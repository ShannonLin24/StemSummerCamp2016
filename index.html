    <h2> About me (a.k.a when you feel like stalking me)</h2>

    <p> Hello! This is Shannon's very first website (ok that is technically not true because I did one before but it was on a practice website so it doesn't count). I have an older brother and a pet frog. I love watermelon (duh) penguins, cats, dogs, unicorns, neko atsume, chocolate, cake, chocboba tea, lokai bracelets, gemstones, sparkly objects, all things anime and kawaii, pusheen, and of course the one animal that brings positivity to the world, Grumpy Cat. Oh, I'm also addicted to Pokemon. Judge me.</p>
    
    <p> Some things that I love doing in life are:</p>
    
    <ol>Figure skating</ol>
    <ul>Art</ul>
    <ol>Reading</ol>
    <ul>Looking up useless facts that are pointless but still very interesting</ul>
    <dl>...And similar to all teens in the world, surfing the 'net like the otaku I am</dl>
